        <h1>Project 1: <br>Online Zine</h1>
        <h5 class="space-below">Create a time capsule of your early internet experience(s) for people in the future.</h5>
        <p class="small">In this class we’ve discussed the history of the internet and the changing ways people
            have
            used it over time. Now, you’ll contribute your own experience to that history. You are some of the last
            people who will be able to remember your lives before the internet! In this project, you’ll document
            the
            internet you first used for people in the future.</p>

        <p class="small">For our first multi-week project, you will research, design, and code a one-page website
            that
            uses images and text to communicate your own early experience in the form of an online zine. What
            website(s) or platform(s) first got you engaged with the internet? Was your internet mostly text-based,
            like a chatroom? Were you making memes and sharing them in forums? Did you take care of your Neopet or
            tend
            your FarmVille farm?</p>

        <p class="small">How can you share the look and feel of these experiences with people who aren’t familiar
            with
            them? How can you use research to find compelling and meaningful imagery and information? And how will
            that
            research shape the design and structure of your one-page website?</p>

        <p class="small">In addition to imagery, consider your site’s layout, typography, color, and
            interaction.
            What feeling are you trying to convey to your audience, and what design choices will reinforce
            that?
            What choices are appropriate for the message or subject you’ve chosen? How can these elements
            enhance
            or emphasize the information you’re presenting?</p>

        <h5>Requirements</h5>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>One-page website</li>
            <li>Combine text and image</li>
            <li>Minimum of 9 images</li>
            <li>The site takes advantage of its screen-based nature, utilizing transparency, hover states, animation,
                or interactivity in a unique fashion</li>
            <li>Use at least one webfont (i.e. not a default font)</li>
            <li>Site needs to be responsive</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p class="small">To approach our projects we’ll use (an accelerated) process similar to what Caroline Sinders
            describes in her piece on <a href="library.html#research" target="_blank">“How to Make
                Research-Driven
                Art”</a></p>
        <blockquote class="space-below-40">
            A research-driven artwork generally progresses in three stages. At the beginning, it’s about having the
            intention to explore an idea, and then (you guessed it) researching that idea. The middle stage focuses on
            moving and shaping an idea as you learn and explore. This part of the process is gray, beautiful, and
            middling—you have to follow where the idea leads. Lastly, it’s about considering possible manifestations or
            outputs that feel appropriate for containing and sharing the body of knowledge you’ve accrued. This
            manifestation should be greatly shaped by the research and guided by the question(s) you’re seeking to
            answer (i.e. your intent). The whole research-driven art process is about building a foundation of
            knowledge and exploration, and then constructing a manifested “artwork”—which can be anything—on top of
            that.
        </blockquote>
        <h5>Part 1: Research and Intent</h5>
        <p class="small space-below-10">First, define the aspect of your early internet experience you want to document
            and why.
            Determine 2 proposals for your time capsule's subject matter and find at least 20 supporting images.</p>
        <p class="small space-below-30"><em>Due 3.12</em></p>

        <h5>Part 2: Moving and Shaping</h5>
        <p class="small space-below-10">Consider the possible manifestations of your work. To do this, collect, parse,
            sketch, and
            formally experiment. Create 2 distinct visual proposals in graphics software, then narrow them down to 1
            final proposal as an interactive prototype.</p>
        <p class="small space-below-30"><em>Due 3.19</em></p>

        <h5>Part 3: Output</h5>
        <p class="small space-below-10">Translate your proposal into an interactive outcome. Consider what the
            transformation between
            an interactive prototype, and actual code enables. Upload your time capsule, and link it to your class
            website.</p>
        <p class="small space-below-30"><em>Due 4.09</em></p>
