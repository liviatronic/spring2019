        <h1>Syllabus</h1>
        <h2>Course Overview</h2>
        <p>This course will explore the possibilities of design online from a conceptual, historical and
            programmatic perspective.</p>
        <p>We will celebrate the Internet as a space for social and creative exchange as well as medium for
            independent expression. However we will also consider the browser as a tool of creative expression, in
            contrast to how it is often presented as a means of pragmatic exchange and consumption.</p>
        <p>Through projects, readings, workshops, and presentations we will explore the relevance of network
            technologies in the context of contemporary art and graphic design practices. </p>
        <p>Students will learn basic HTML, CSS, and JS programming along with methods for conceptualizing,
            designing, and developing websites. Outcomes won't necessary be practical, nor pragmatically
            functional. Instead we will strive for a poetic understanding of design and the Internet as mediums for
            critical research and discourse.</p>

        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>Develop a theoretical knowledge, technical understanding, and historical basis of the internet and
                design online</li>
            <li>Develop technical skills (HTML, CSS, and JS) to produce functioning websites</li>
            <li>Stimulate critical positions around design principles within networked technologies </li>
            <li>Analyze current digital aesthetics and their historical context</li>
            <li>Understand the social and cultural implications of information flows online</li>
            <li>Explore the Internet as a space that is public and private, and the corporate and political
                tensions embedded in such condition</li>
            <li>Gain insight into the contemporary landscape of Internet-based art and design practices</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>Readings</h2>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>Each student will be responsible for presenting a short verbal summary of one reading, and leading
                a class discussion around it. Sign up for your week to present in <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Readings--AWLNyg3nZllFobUI8vxohUVyAQ-jQ2DgXyzN2q3vINr4Ixwt"

            <li>For every reading, each student must submit 3 questions to that week’s Paper doc (viewable in the
                Calendar section of this website) before 1pm the day of the assigned reading discussion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>In-Class Activities</h2>
        <p class="small">Tuesdays generally consists of any combination of the following:</p>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>Reading presentation/discussion</li>
            <li>Topic lecture/discussion</li>
            <li>Project critique/discussion</li>
            <li>Group activity</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="small">Thursdays generally consists of any combination of the following:</p>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>Skill based workshop</li>
            <li>Personal working time</li>
            <li>One one one meeting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>60% ... Projects 1 and 2</li>
            <li>30% ... Workshop / Weekly Exercises</li>
            <li>10% ... Reading Presentation and Participation (reading responses, class discussion, critique,
                etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">Letter grades represent the following:</p>
        <p class="small">A = excellent;<br />
            B = good;<br />
            C = satisfactory;<br />
            D = unsatisfactory;<br />
            F = failure.</p>
        <p class="small">A grade of C- or less is considered a failing grade for required courses within the major, and
            you will
            need to retake this course if you achieve a grade lower than a C.</p>

        <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <p class="small">Attendance is required. Students are expected to be on time and remain in class for the entire
            period
            scheduled. Work missed due to any type of absence is the student’s responsibility. Three or more
            absences will result in a failing grade. Three arrivals later than 15 minutes after class begins equals
            an absence. If you absolutely must miss class, email me in advance.</p>

        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p class="small">Students are expected to generate their own work. At the same time the nature of the web is
            inherently
            build on sharing knowledge and resources, and building upon others work – as such we will get familiar
            with using pre-existing code, language, and imagery as materials we shape into our own unique projects.
            We will learn how to appropriate mindfully, and credit work properly.</p>

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p class="small">Remixing existing code is often an important part of learning, but any code you take from an
            online
            resource needs to be commented with the source location where it appears in your project. For example:</p>
        <code>
            <pre>For HTML
              
&lt;!-- source: http://cool.biz/cool_code -- &gt;
&lt;div id="coolThing"&gt;
    does a cool thing.
        &lt;div id="helpsDoACoolThing"&gt;
    &lt; /div&gt;
&lt; /div&gt;
              
or for CSS
              
/* source: http://cool.biz/cool_code */
#doesACoolThing {
    cool: thing;
}
              
or for Javascript
              
// source: http://cool.biz/cool_code
function doACoolThing(){
  does a cool thing.
}</pre></code>

        <p class="small">Further, when using found code make sure that your use of it is appropriate to your project,
            and outside
            code should not dictate the design of your projects as experienced by the user. If the function or
            style of your site is identical to your source, that is likely a problem. Any snippets of code on the
            <a href="http://spring2019.designing.tools/resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resources
                page</a> are free to use. If you are unsure if your reuse of code is appropriate, ask!</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p class="small">You may not use graphics, images, video, audio, or any other design elements that you did not
            create
            yourself, or that are obvious recreations of others work, under the pretense that they are your work.
            With the possible exemption of: </p>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>Graphics such as a Facebook or Twitter icon in reference to those sites, etc, and that only in
                accordance with those organizations guidelines for such an elements use. In such cases those
                graphics should be a minor element in your design. </li>
            <li>If an assignment requires you to display found imagery and it is properly attributed </li>
            <li>Use of imagery in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Creative
                    Commons</a> that is cited and used based on its license</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">If you are unsure if the use of a design element is appropriate, ask!</p>

        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <p class="small">Unless stipulated by an assignment, or approved by the instructor, all written content should
            be written
            by you. If it is approved by the instructor, make sure to cite the text appropriately.</p>

        <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
        <p class="small">Any exercise or project that you submit for grading must be uploaded to your class website
            before each
            class. Even if you are done with your work on your local computer, it will be considered late work if
            it is not visible on your class website.</p>
        <p class="small">If a project is not uploaded on time, it will be docked one letter grade per class meeting
            that it is
            late. You can resubmit your work at the end of the semester with revisions to be regraded.</p>

        <h2>Class Archive</h2>
        <p class="small">At the end of the term, you will be required to send me an archival .zip file to document your
            projects.
            If you do not send me the archive, you will fail the class.</p>
        <p class="small">Please follow the instructions below:</p>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>Divide your materials into three project folders: Workshop, P1, P2. Within each project folder,
                make three new folders: Project, Documentation,
                Description.</li>
            <li>Put all of your project materials (code and required assets) into the Project folder.</li>
            <li>In the Documentation folder, place a series of .png files, or a video screen capture (made using
                Quicktime) to concisely document your project.</li>
            <li>Within the Description folder, place a text file containing a paragraph description of your
                project.</li>
            <li>When you make the .zip file, send it to me over wetransfer.com.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">Remember:</p>
        <ul class="small">
            <li>When creating the archive, make sure your assets are optimized for web so that the file sizes are
                as small as possible</li>
            <li>Make sure every link on your class homepage is working.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p class="small">This course was developed in 2019 in collaboration with chris hamamoto
            and Will
            Ruby. It is based on a course that was designed with Federico Pérez Villoro in 2017, and influenced by
            curriculums developed by <a href="http://www.designforthe.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mindy
                Seu</a>, <a href="http://clementvalla.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clement Valla</a>,
            and <a href="http://laurelschwulst.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laurel Schwulst</a>,
            and past versions of Interactive 1 at CCA.</p>
        <p class="small">It was
            adapted from a site developed by Laurel Schwulst. </p>
